IT HAS TO BE CHANGED: 


routes.py FILE :

	the static URL '/home/marla/newTimelineApp/app/static/naf' in the "naf2json()" function : the new URL should be refer to a folder that contains a .naf file.


I propose for the module of printing the NAF file structure to use a smaller file. 
Using a really big one Firefox is almost crashing. 
The naf files are stored in the folder app/static/naf.
If you changed the naf file that I am already using you should change the URL at the static/js/main.js file in the function "#nafStructureExample". Also you have to change the format of the file from .naf to .xml

To run the application localy you should do the following: 

	$ cd timelineApplication
	$ . bin/activate
	$ cd app
	$ python routes.py
